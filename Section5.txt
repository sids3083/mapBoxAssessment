Steps toÂ encounters performance issues in database:

	1.	Monitor Database Metrics: Like, CPU usage, disk I/O, and buffer cache hit ratio.
	2.	Check Cloud Infrastructure: 
        (i) Location of Database 
        (ii) increase database resources if required 
        (iii) Use node balancers if traffic is too much.
	3.	Identify Slow Apis Or Queries: Identify/Analyse queries using logs present in logger.
	4.	Optimize Queries: Optimize identified queries by removing irrelevant parameters, joins, loops, etc.
	5.	Review Database Models:Ensure tables have primary keys and foreign keys where necessary, Normalize or denormalize tables based on query patterns, Optimize data types, etc
	6.	Caching: We can use caching to reduce the load on database.

Note: There can be many more steps depending on situations.
